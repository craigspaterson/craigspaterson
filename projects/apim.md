#### Azure API Management (APIM) Solution

**Cognizant, Solution Architect, April 2016 - Present**

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform**
  * Engineered a fully automated IaC solution using Terraform to provision and manage Azure API Management service, virtual networks, and other related services, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments.
  
- **Environment Management**
  * Implemented a multi-environment setup, including Dev, Test, and Production environments, leveraging Azure DevOps pipelines and Git branching strategies. Configured environment-specific variables and secrets for seamless deployments.

- **Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy**
  * Formulated and executed a comprehensive DR strategy using Azureâ€™s Geo-Replication and Backup services. Conducted routine DR drills to validate the recovery process and RTO/RPO compliance.

- **Security Model Implementation**
  * Integrated Azure AD and OAuth2 for identity and access management. Enabled role-based access control (RBAC) for internal users and API keys for external users, ensuring secure and granular API access.

- **Separation of IaC and APIOps Lifecycle**
  * Designed the project architecture to distinctly separate IaC from APIOps code and lifecycle. Managed the IaC configurations in a dedicated Git repository and API configurations and code in separate repositories, improving modularity and ease of maintenance.

- **Developer Portal Deployment & Customization**
  * Deployed Azure's APIM Developer Portal and performed extensive customization using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Integrated Swagger documentation and sample API calls for improved user experience.

- **Extended Security Model to Developer Portal**
  * Enhanced the security of the Developer Portal by extending the Azure AD-based security model. Configured SSO (Single Sign-On) and MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) to strengthen security postures for both internal and external users.

**Technologies Used:** Azure API Management, Terraform, Azure DevOps, Git, Azure AD, OAuth2, Azure Virtual Networks, PowerShell, Bash
